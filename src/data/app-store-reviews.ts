C'est comme un conseiller financier IA : demandez si vous pouvez acheter un ordinateur avant une date précise, et il planifie tout. L'interface true black mauve est top sur iPhone, et elle est en français complet (ajustez la fiche App Store). Bugs à fixer : À police système maximale, textes illisibles/chevauchés. Affichage coupé police agrandie (autres captures). Nom utilisateur illisible ; utilisez prénom. Écriture invisible en nommant espace. 5 étoiles malgré tout. Excellente app, améliorez l'accessibilité svp !",

It's also a lot more budget friendly than other apps which charge exorbitant fees for anyone who doesn't have a lot of disposable income. There's even a lifetime plan for a fair price. My personal favorite thing though is that while it's not quite on par with other apps in terms of features like automation and syncing, it's moving very fast in that direction, and I have hope that it'll be a top option soon.",
