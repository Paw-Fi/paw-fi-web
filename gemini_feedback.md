Excellent. I've reviewed the provided changes. Here is my feedback.

### Code Review

Overall, this is a very good refactoring that simplifies the dark mode implementation for the `AmbientHalo` component. By moving the dark theme overrides directly into the CSS variables within a `.dark` class, you've eliminated the need for conditional `dark:` utility classes in the component markup. This centralizes the theme logic, making it cleaner and easier to maintain.

#### Suggestions (Consider Improving)

*   **Consistency Check:** This refactoring pattern is excellent. It might be worth checking if other components in the codebase use conditional `dark:` classes for colors that could be similarly refactored to use CSS variables for a more consistent theming approach across the application.

There are no critical issues or warnings to report. This is a high-quality contribution that improves code maintainability. Great work.
